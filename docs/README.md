# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management process documentation. This central hub provides team members with a comprehensive guide to our project management philosophy, workflows, and best practices.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on principles of clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Our processes are designed to deliver customer value through iterative, well-coordinated team efforts.

### Our Project Management Philosophy

Based on our established processes, OctoAcme's project management relies on:

- **Defined workflows** for sprint planning, issue triage, code review, and retrospective sessions, ensuring clarity and repeatability across all projects
- **Clearly described roles**, including Project Managers, Developers, Reviewers, and QA Engineers, with outlined responsibilities that promote accountability and effective collaboration
- **Transparent and traceable communication**—via Issues, Pull Requests, and regular standups—fostering collaboration and surfacing blockers early to keep projects on track
- **Integrated quality assurance** throughout the entire development process, with automated and manual reviews, well-defined acceptance criteria, and regular retrospectives for continuous improvement

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to reduce risk and gather feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named leaders and well-defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless problem-solving
